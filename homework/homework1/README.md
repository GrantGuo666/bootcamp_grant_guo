# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
The supply chain for a global retailer is experiencing inefficiencies due to unpredictabble demand, inventory shrotages and delays in shopments. Solving these issues are critical to the company as these issues are causing stockouts and excess inventory level, and therefore impact the profitability of the retailer. Identifying the key drivers of inefficiency and predicting future demand accurately is significant for optimizing inventory management and improving operational efficiency.
## Stakeholder & User
The stakeholder is the head of supply chain management department. The users are logistics managers and inventory professionals who will use the outputs to adjust inventory levels. The decision-making process happens on a weekly basis.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The project will provide predictive insights into demand forecasting and descrpitve analyses of historical supply chain inefficiencies. These insights will help inform deicisions about adjusting inventory levels to avoid stockouts and excess inventory.

## Assumptions & Constraints
•Historical sales data and current inventory levels are accessible and accurate  

•Forecasting models can be updated on a weekly basis to account for seasonality and changing demand patterns

•The model needs to integrate with existing warehouse management systemsn and supply chain tools

## Known Unknowns / Risks
•Data might be imcomplete

•External factors and Blakcswan events such as geopolitical conflicts and pandemic may not be accounted for in the model

•The model might stuggle with new product lines that lack historical data

•Forecasting accuracy may deteriorate during periods of unforseen demand spikes
## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
•Optimize inventory levels -> Problem Framing & Scoping -> Project scoping document

•Predict future demand -> Data exploration and modeling -> Demand forecasting model

•Improve inventory level decision-making efficiency -> Deployment & Integration -> Automated forecasting system, integrating with existing warehouse management tools
